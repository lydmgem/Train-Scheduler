# Train-Scheduler

In this assignment, I am to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The website will retrieve and manipulate this information via jQuery and it will provide up-to-date information about various trains, arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at the station.
